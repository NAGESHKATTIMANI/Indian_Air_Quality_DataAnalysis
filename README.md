# Indian_Air_Quality_DataAnalysis

## Project Title:
Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis Dashboard for Indian Cities

## Objective:
To design an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard that analyzes air quality trends across major Indian cities, identifying pollution hotspots, dominant pollutants, and seasonal variations to support public awareness and environmental policymaking.

## Dataset used : 
<a href= "https://github.com/NAGESHKATTIMANI/Indian_Air_Quality_DataAnalysis/blob/main/airqualityindex_data.csv">Indian Air Quality Index data</a>

## Tools & Technologies Used:
Power BI – for data visualization and dashboard creation

Microsoft Excel / Pandas – for data cleaning and preprocessing

Data Source – Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) / Kaggle AQI datasets

Maps and Custom Visuals – for geo-spatial analysis

## Features of the Dashboard:
Overall AQI Trends:
Visualizes AQI over time across different cities to detect improvements or deterioration in air quality.

Pollutant-wise Breakdown:
Highlights levels of pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃; identifies dominant pollutants per city.

City & State Comparison:
Compares AQI between cities/states using bar charts and heat maps to identify the most and least polluted areas.

Interactive Filtering:
Allows users to filter data by city, state, AQI category, time period, or specific pollutant.

Geo-spatial Mapping:
Displays AQI levels across the Indian map using color-coded visual indicators.

## Insights Derived:
Cities like Delhi and Kanpur consistently showed higher AQI values due to PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations.

AQI worsened during the winter months, likely due to inversion and biomass burning.

Southern cities maintained better air quality compared to northern industrial hubs.

Pollutants like NO₂ and CO showed periodic spikes in high-traffic areas.

Description : This dashboard provides an overview of air quality across various cities. It highlights PM10 and PM2.5 levels using gauges and visualizes the chemical composition of air (like Nitrogen Oxides, Ozone, Sulphur Dioxide) through a donut chart.

Description : This slide uses the Key Influencers visual to identify major factors affecting PM2.5 levels. It shows that higher Nitric Oxide concentrations have the strongest correlation with increased PM2.5 values.

## Impact & Applications:
Can be used by policymakers for environmental planning and city-level interventions.

Helps the public understand pollution trends and take preventive actions.

Can be extended with real-time data APIs for a live AQI monitoring portal.
